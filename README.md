1. **No Git Repository Initialized:** You may not have initialized a Git repository in the directory where you're running the `git status` command. In that case, you need to initialize a new Git repository using the `git init` command.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Incorrect Directory:** You might be running the `git status` command in a different directory than the one where your Git repository is located. Make sure you are in the correct directory by using the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your project files are stored.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/directory
   ```

3. **.gitignore:** add below into .gitignore & data from https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/node
